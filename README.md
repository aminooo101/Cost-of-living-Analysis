# Cost of Living Index Analysis

## Introduction

The Cost of Living Index is a critical metric that reflects the relative expense of living in various countries. It encompasses a wide range of factors, including the price of groceries, housing, transportation, and other essential goods and services. Understanding the Cost of Living Index is crucial for individuals, businesses, and policymakers as it helps inform decisions related to relocation, investment, and wage adjustments.

In this analysis, we will explore the Cost of Living Index across different countries and regions for the year 2024. By comparing the cost of living across various countries, we aim to gain insights into which regions are the most and least expensive to live in, and how different indices such as the Rent Index and Grocery Index correlate with the overall cost of living.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Identify the countries with the highest and lowest Cost of Living Index.**
2. **Analyze the relationship between the Rent Index and the Cost of Living Index.**
3. **Examine how the Cost of Living Index varies across different regions.**
4. **Investigate other factors (e.g., Grocery Index) that may influence the Cost of Living Index.**
